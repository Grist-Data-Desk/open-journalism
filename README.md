# Open Journalism

*A list of github accounts of various news organizations. This list powers the [@newsnerdrepos](https://twitter.com/newsnerdrepos) Twitterbot. List maintained by [Scott Klein](https://twitter.com/kleinmatic) and [Silva Shih](https://twitter.com/silvashih).*

If you know of a newsroom (or journalism-adjacent group) posting code to github that we're missing, let us know by filing an issue or sending a pull request!
